# User-Registration-and-Login-App-for-Multiple-User
Creating a user registration and login app for multiple users is a common requirement in many web applications. 
We're developing a Flask app where users can input basic information such as their name, email, and password. 
The app will securely store this data in a database for user management and authentication.
